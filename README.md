This repository demonstrates an example of an uncommon but significant error in Python: an unclosed file.  The file 'bug.py' contains code with a function that opens a file but fails to close it using `f.close()` This can lead to resource exhaustion and unexpected behavior.  The solution, provided in 'bugSolution.py', uses a `with` statement to ensure the file is automatically closed even if exceptions occur.
